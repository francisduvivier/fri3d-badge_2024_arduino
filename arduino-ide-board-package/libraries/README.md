## TFT_eSPI-master
This directory is a copy of the [TFT_eSPI fork made by @FedericoBusero](https://github.com/FedericoBusero/TFT_eSPI).  
Reason for forking is that otherwise the display is mirrored, this fork adds extra rotation options. Rotation option 5 is the one to be used by the Fri3d Badge 2024.
